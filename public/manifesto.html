            <p>
                The internet didn't end with a bang. It ended with a Terms of Service update.
            </p>
            </p>
                While you were sleeping, they seized your voice, your face, and your history. They replaced ownership with a monthly rent check. They put a subscription model on your heated seats, a loading wheel on your memories, and a price tag on your privacy.
            </p>

            <div class="dystopia-box">
                <p><span class="glitch-title">THIS DYSTOPIA IS BORING</span></p>
                <p class="subtext">It is cleaner than we feared, but far more insidious.</p>
                <p class="verdict">A digital slum built on rented land, where every interaction is a toll booth and every platform is a cage.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- 1. THE ROOTS -->
            <div class="section-header">&gt; 1. THE ROOTS</div>

            <p>
                Thirty years ago, the <a href="/cypherpunk" style="color: var(--terminal);">Cypherpunks</a> saw the walls closing in. They understood that centralized systems eventually serve the center, not the edges. Their response wasn't political — it was architectural.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Build systems where privacy is the default, not a feature.</span>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Their mandate was absolute: <span class="highlight">Privacy is necessary. Write the code.</span>
            </p>

            <!-- 2. THE ROT -->
            <div class="section-header">&gt; 2. THE ROT</div>

            <p>
                But the code wasn't enough to stop the incentive of greed. Cory Doctorow gave the resulting disease a name: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys" target="_blank" style="color: var(--warning); text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--warning);">Enshittification</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the terminal stage of platform capitalism. First, they lure you in with magic; then, they lock the doors; finally, they stop building entirely to strip the copper from the walls.
            </p>

            <p>
                The platforms are now structurally unable to risk the kind of innovation they once lived on. <span class="highlight">They are terrified of the very instincts that built them.</span>
            </p>

            <!-- 3. THE PIVOT -->
            <div class="section-header">&gt; 3. THE PIVOT</div>

             <p>
                While the platforms were building bureaucracies, <span class="highlight">the pioneers were writing open-source, privacy-first code.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                We inherited decades of their work. The barriers to entry have shifted from the material to the intellectual — from capital to curiosity. In an era of instant information, the price of entry has never been lower.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is not frictionless. Self-hosting is work. Ownership has overhead. But the nature of the work has changed. AI now handles the grunt work — reading documentation, scaffolding the unfamiliar, explaining errors — leaving you to be the architect.
            </p>

            <p class="emphasis">
                The path is clearer than it has ever been. Build in the open. Document as you go. <span class="highlight">Become the foundation for whoever comes next.</span>
            </p>

            <!-- 4. THE RULES -->
            <div class="section-header">&gt; 4. THE RULES</div>

            <p>
                We are done with promises. Promises are broken in board meetings. To resist the rot, we build with <span class="highlight">Architectural Immunity</span>.
            </p>

            <ul class="mandate-list">
                <li><span class="label">Local-First:</span> If it can't run without their servers, you're a tenant. Local is the foundation — meshes are how tenants become neighbours.</li>
                <li><span class="label">True Ownership:</span> If you don't hold the keys, you don't own the data. Export must be lossless, legible, and yours to replicate.</li>
                <li><span class="label">No Kill Switch:</span> If a vendor, a government, or a boardroom can brick your device, the design is hostile by intent.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 5. THE PURPOSE -->
            <div class="section-header">&gt; 5. THE PURPOSE</div>

            <p>
                This is not a lifestyle choice or a moral sermon. Convenience will always win for the masses, and no one owes their time to infrastructure they didn't ask to manage.
            </p>

            <p>
                But a system that offers no credible alternative is not convenient — <span class="highlight">it's coercive</span>. Our work is about making the exit <em>real</em>, <em>functional</em>, and <em>respected</em>.
            </p>

            <p class="emphasis">
                When a genuine option to leave exists, power behaves differently.
            </p>

            <p>
                The presence of a viable path outside the platforms is what keeps them honest. We aren't just building tools. <span class="highlight">We are building a structural safeguard for digital agency.</span>
            </p>

            <!-- 6. THE REVEAL -->
            <div class="section-header">&gt; 6. THE EXIT</div>

            <p>
                The Cypherpunks told you to write the code. Doctorow gave a name to the rot.
            </p>

            <p>
                We're telling you <span class="highlight">the cage is unlocked.</span> The bars aren't made of steel; they're made of habit and the false comfort of a "convenient" login.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are waiting for a permission slip that will never come. The door is already open.
            </p>

            <p class="emphasis">
                <span class="highlight">You just have to stop paying for the lock.</span>
            </p>

            <div class="section-header">&gt; 7. THE SIGNAL</div>
            <p>
                The rotting, rent-seeking monoliths have marketing departments, sales teams, and cold-call budgets. They will find you. They will email you. They will buy ads until you submit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Open-source, local-first projects have none of that. They build tools that work and vanish into the noise. Nobody is paying for ads to tell you about software that respects your ownership.
            </p>

            <p class="emphasis">
                This is the discoverability problem. Great privacy respecting software doesn't cold-call. <span class="highlight">It just exists, waiting to be found.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                So we're building infrastructure with teeth. A <a href="/directory" style="color: var(--terminal);">public registry</a> that isn't just a list — it's a pipeline.
