No cloud account, no login—just your box, your network, your data. It stores photos, journals, bank exports, health data, and more locally, running AI analysis entirely on your hardware. Think of it as a private server for your life, with an AI that works only for you."

Nobody can read each other's shards. If your house burns down or LocalGhost goes bankrupt, your data survives. Uses Reed-Solomon encoding requiring only 50% of shards to reconstruct."

Each box maintains a partial address book of other boxes with mathematically 'close' IDs. To find data, you ask known boxes who's closest to the shard's ID, hopping 3-4 times to find anything—even in millions of nodes. No central directory; the network IS the directory. Uses Kademlia-style DHT like BitTorrent and IPFS."

If law enforcement comes with a warrant, compliance looks like: 'We have no data, no logs, don't know who uses our hardware. Here's our open-source code. Good luck.' The architecture is the legal defense."

        <div class="manifesto">
            <p class="manifesto-quote">
                <a href="/cypherpunk" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">
                    "Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world."<br>
                    — <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--terminal);">A Cypherpunk's Manifesto, 1993</span>
                </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The Cypherpunks told us to write code. We didn't write enough. Today, your phone is a tracker,
                your cloud is an informant, and your AI is a spy. Every click is logged. Every query is sold.
                Every interaction trains a model you will never own.
            </p>

            <p>
                LocalGhost inverts this. We move everything you need—your AI, your data, your digital self—from
                their servers to yours. A private server where nobody can see you. Where nobody even knows you exist.
            </p>

                We do not ask you to trust us. We ask you to verify that you don't have to.

        <h2>THE FLEET: LOCAL_DAEMONS</h2>

        <p>
            We built a fleet of agents—Daemons—that run locally on the hardware.
            They are not "smart assistants." They are specialized scripts designed to ingest
            the chaos of your life and organize it into a coherent truth, without a single byte leaving the box.

        <h2>THE ECONOMICS OF INDEPENDENCE</h2>
        <h3>Why we will never ask for a subscription.</h3>

        <p>
            The modern technology industry is built on a single, toxic premise: <strong>Rent-seeking.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            They don't want to sell you a product; they want to trap you in a monthly payment.
            They want you to be a tenant in your own digital life. If you stop paying, the lights go out.
            If you stop paying, they lock the doors to your memories.
        </p>

        <p style="color: var(--terminal); font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
            We reject this. Not everything needs to be a subscription.
        </p>

        <p>
            At LocalGhost, our business model is boring, archaic, and honest:
        </p>

        <div class="economics-point">
            <h4>1. WE MAKE MONEY WHEN WE SELL YOU HARDWARE</h4>
            <p>
                If you choose to buy a pre-built LocalGhost box from us, we charge you a 30% margin
                on the parts and assembly. That is our profit. It pays for our engineers, our electricity, and our coffee.
            </p>
            <div class="choice">
                <strong>The Choice:</strong> If you don't want to pay us, you don't have to.
                The hardware specs are open. The code is open. You can buy the parts on Newegg,
                download our repo, and build it yourself. We will not earn a cent, and we will still high-five you for doing it.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="economics-point">
            <h4>2. WE MAKE MONEY WHEN WE SELL YOU UPGRADES (SOFTWARE)</h4>
            <p>
                We treat software like a tool, not a service. If we develop a breakthrough new Agent—say,
                a "Shadow v2.0" with better reasoning, or a "Medical Auditor" module—we will put it in a package
                and put a price tag on it.
            </p>
            <div class="choice">
                <strong>The Choice:</strong> You can buy it, or you can ignore it.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="economics-point">
            <h4>3. WE NEVER MONETIZE YOU</h4>
            <p>We cannot sell your data because we do not have it.</p>
            <p>We cannot train AI on your life because we cannot see it.</p>
            <p>We cannot show you ads because the box has no ad server.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guarantee-box">
            <h4>⚡ CODE, NOT PROMISES</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="emphasis">The Guarantee:</span> If you don't buy an upgrade, your current version
                will keep working forever. We will never throttle, brick, or degrade your existing system to force an upgrade.

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <span class="emphasis">Why?</span> Because we can't.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you unplug the ethernet cable or block the port, this box is an independent island.
                We have no "backdoor." We have no "remote kill switch." We have no "admin access."
                Even if we wanted to force an update, the architecture prevents us from reaching you.
            </p>
            <p style="color: var(--terminal); margin-bottom: 0;">
                We have designed ourselves out of the loop. You are not relying on our goodwill;
                you are relying on the fact that we are technically powerless to stop you.

                        It's a small, silent box that sits on your desk or shelf. You plug it into power, connect it to your Wi-Fi, 
                        and insert the two hardware security keys that come with it. That's the setup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once connected, you access it through a local web interface (like <code>http://ghost.local</code>) when you're home, 
                        or through a secure tunnel when you're away. No cloud account. No login. Just your box, your network, your data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From there, you can sync anything to it: photos from your phone, journals, bank exports, health data, browser history, 
                        notes, voice memos—whatever you want to track. The box stores it all locally, tags it, indexes it, and runs AI analysis 
                        entirely on your hardware.

                    <p>
                        The Mist is a peer-to-peer backup network. Here's the simple version:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Step 1: Shred.</strong> Your data gets encrypted with a key only you hold. Then it gets chopped into thousands of tiny pieces called "shards." 
                        Each shard is meaningless on its own—like confetti from a shredded document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Step 2: Scatter.</strong> Those shards get distributed across other LocalGhost boxes in the network. 
                        Your shards live on dozens of strangers' drives. Their shards live on yours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Step 3: Rebuild.</strong> When you need your data back, your box collects the shards from the network and reassembles them. 
                        Only your encryption key can make sense of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The beauty:</strong> The people storing your shards can't read them—they're encrypted and incomplete. 
                        You can't read theirs either. Nobody knows whose data they're holding. The network doesn't even know you exist.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: var(--terminal);">
                        If your house burns down, your data survives. If LocalGhost goes bankrupt, your data survives. 
                        The network has no central point of failure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="faq-technical">
                        <strong>Technical note:</strong> This uses erasure coding similar to how Ethereum's PeerDAS works for data availability sampling. 
                        We use Reed-Solomon encoding so you only need ~50% of shards to reconstruct your data, 
                        making the system resilient even if half the network goes offline.

                        This is the magic of distributed hash tables (DHT). Here's how it works in plain English:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Bootstrap Problem:</strong> When your box first connects to the network, it needs to know at least one other box. 
                        We publish a small list of "bootstrap nodes"—these are just regular LocalGhost boxes run by volunteers who've agreed to be discoverable. 
                        Your box contacts one of these to get introduced to the network. After that, it never needs us again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Address Book:</strong> Every box on the network has a unique ID (a long random number). 
                        Each box maintains a partial "address book" of other boxes it knows about. But here's the clever bit: 
                        you don't need to know everyone. You just need to know boxes whose IDs are "close" to yours in the mathematical sense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Hop Game:</strong> When you need to find a specific shard, you ask the boxes you know: "Who's closest to this shard's ID?" 
                        They point you to someone closer. You ask that box the same question. Within 3-4 hops, you've found what you're looking for—even in a network of millions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>No Phone Book Server:</strong> There's no central directory. The network IS the directory. 
                        If any box goes offline, the others route around it automatically. The more boxes join, the more resilient it gets.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: var(--terminal);">
                        Think of it like asking for directions in a city with no street signs. You ask a local, they point you to someone who knows better, 
                        and within a few asks you're at your destination. No map company required.
                    </p>
                    <p class="faq-technical">
                        <strong>Technical note:</strong> We use a Kademlia-style DHT, the same algorithm that powers BitTorrent and IPFS. 
                        Node distance is calculated using XOR on node IDs. Each node maintains k-buckets of peers at exponentially increasing distances, 
                        giving O(log n) lookup time. The protocol is UDP-based for speed, with optional QUIC tunneling for NAT traversal.

                        Then your data is gone. Forever. This is not a bug—it's the point.
                    </p>

                        We cannot recover your data because we never had access to it. There is no "forgot password" flow.

                    <p>
                        <strong>The good news:</strong> Every LocalGhost box ships with <strong>two hardware security keys</strong>. 
                        When you first set up the box, you plug both keys in simultaneously. The box generates your master encryption key 
                        and splits it between the two keys using Shamir's Secret Sharing—neither key alone can decrypt anything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>How to use them:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul class="faq-list-items">
                        <li><strong>Key 1:</strong> Keep this one with your box for daily use. Plug it in to unlock your data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Key 2:</strong> Store this somewhere safe and separate—a bank vault, a trusted friend's house, your parents' place. This is your recovery key.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you lose Key 1, you can use Key 2 to generate a new pair. If your house burns down with both the box and Key 1 inside, 
                        Key 2 can restore everything to a new box. But if you lose both keys? Game over.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: var(--warning);">
                        Real ownership means real responsibility. Two keys. Two locations. No excuses.

                    <p class="faq-technical">
                        <strong>Technical note:</strong> The keys are FIDO2-compliant hardware tokens with secure elements. 
                        The master key never leaves the secure enclave—only the derived decryption keys are used at runtime. 
                        We use 2-of-2 Shamir's Secret Sharing for the split, with an optional 2-of-3 mode if you purchase an additional backup key.

                        Every LocalGhost box ships with a built-in encrypted VPN. When enabled, your phone or laptop connects directly to your box 
                        over the internet through an end-to-end encrypted tunnel. It's like being on your home network, but from anywhere. 
                        Your traffic never touches our servers—because we don't have any.

                        For the truly paranoid: disable all remote access. The box only works when you're physically on your home network. 
                        When you leave, it's a black hole. When you return, it's there waiting.
